# This audit log contains an attack used to gain access to database.db. In a few 
# sentences, describe the attack. (2 points)
The attacker accesses apache and then opens a bash shell (PID 1654) which is used to read database.db
Once they create the bash shell they
-access library files
-execute whoami (allows them to see the logged in user) (PID 1656)
-read the cpuinfo (allows them to see information about the CPUs in the system) (PID 1657)
-examine the current directory with ls to find the path for the home directory (PID 1658)
-examine the home directory to find the location of database.db (PID 1659)
-examine the home direcotry with ls to find database.db (1660)
